                  <p>Conductor Mario Dobernig grew up in a small village in the Austrian Alps before establishing his professional career as a percussionist in Graz (Austria) and Helsinki (Finland) where he worked extensively with many chamber orchestras and with ensembles such as the Graz Opera, Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Tapiola Sinfonietta and the Avanti! chamber orchestra. 

Mario graduated from the Art University Graz and the Sibelius Academy Helsinki. He also holds a Masters degree in Musicology from the University of Helsinki. Mario moved to Melbourne to pursue his conducting studies with John Hopkins OBE at the University of Melbourne, where he completed a Master of Music in Conducting in 2009. He is currently completing his PhD at the University of Melbourne, where he produces a performance edition of Peggy Glanville-Hicks’s opera Nausicaa. 

In 2011, Mario conducted Stravinsky’s Histoire du Soldat for the Woodend Winter Arts Festival, which was broadcasted on ABC classic FM. Mario has conducted ensembles at the University of Melbourne, the Victorian College of the Arts Symphony Orchestra, the Youth Philharmonic Melbourne, the Ballarat Symphony, the Ballarat Wind Orchestra, the Preston Symphony and the Kooyong Chamber Players. Since 2012 Mario is the resident conductor of the Preston Symphony and the Musical Director of Victoria Chorale. He really enjoys making music with the Barrier Reef Orchestra.</p>

        <h2>Barrier Reef Orchestra</h2>
              <h4>President’s Report</h4>
              <small>For 2015 AGM North Queensland Ensembles Inc.</small>

<p> 

The Barrier Reef Orchestra is in a sound financial position with concert attendance and revenue from tickets up for 2013. 

The Orchestra performed on six occasions over the last 12 months. This included a children’s concert at Riverway featuring music from Harry Potter and Peter and the Wolf. The concert was well received by the audience and the Orchestra got into the mood by dressing up appropriately for their musical characters. 

Masterworks conducted by Mark Sheills and featuring the 2013 Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner was performed in September with a follow up performance in the Burdekin. Sadly the Burdekin concert was not well attended despite the best efforts in advertising and extra signage. 

Last Night of the Proms was performed in November and conducted by Richard McIntyre. As expected the audience join in with the antics. 

The new year saw the successful season launch at the Pier Restaurant and featured our new harp much to the enjoyment of those present. The Mayor of Townsville, Councillor Jenny Hill, officially launched the 2015 season and spoke of the importance of the Barrier Reef Orchestra to Townsville. Not long after that was Sounds of Romance conducted by Raymond Yong. The issue of parking problems were extreme and the matter was taken up with Council. Hopefully there will not be a repeat performance. 

The Orchestra was invited to open the Townsville Arts Awards with a cameo performance of the music from Frozen much to the audiences’ pleasure, particularly with the AV accompaniment. The Barrier Reef Orchestra will conduct the second Conducting Workshop at the end of May as it was so successful in 2013. 

For the rest of the year there is our support to the AFCM concert, our World Music Concert commissioned by the Civic Theatre (a first for BRO), support to DanceNorth with their Twilight performances and lastly a Musical Feast for November. 

To make all of this happen there is a dynamic and committed committee working away to bring this all together. I thank them all for their magnificent work. My thanks also goes to our major sponsor the Townsville City Council, our generous benefactors and to the Orchestra Manager Sally Frewen-Lord who has found time to run a survey for the musicians to get some feedback on how we do business. Thank you all. 

Jeff Nielsen has reworked our website and taken great steps forward in producing a functional and relevant website. Jeff is handing it over to the next person to continue the good work, Thanks Jeff. I will be introducing life members later as a way of marking the Barrier Reef Orchestra 15th Anniversary. 

The Barrier Reef Orchestra has taken the opportunity to be directly involved with the development of the TPAC proposal. I see it as necessary support to all of the arts organisations to promote the need for more performance spaces in Townsville and I would urge you all to visit the website and help spread the word. Simon has injected himself into this project with the usual eye for detail while keeping appraised of the macro developments in Townsville. Thanks Simon for your energy and incisive views on this important project. 

The 15th anniversary year of BRO has been marked by several approaches to the Orchestra to perform in support of other arts organisations. I take this as a sign of confidence others see in our Orchestra and acceptance of the Barrier Reef Orchestra as Townsville’s resident cultural cornerstone to orchestral music. A fitting milestone for the 15th year of the Barrier Reef Orchestra.</p>

                  <p>Richard has maintained a long and distinguished career as bassoonist, music educator, conductor and arranger. A Composition graduate from Sydney University, he was appointed Associate Principal Bassoon with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra as a 20-year-old in 1968, moving to The Canberra School of Music as a foundation member of the Canberra Wind Soloists in 1978. With this renowned quintet, he recorded and toured internationally during a 30-year period, and gave it a unique repertoire with his virtuoso arrangements of large-scale orchestral works. He was for many years Principal Bassoon with the Australian Chamber Orchestra, and appeared on many occasions as guest Principal Bassoon with most of the Symphony Australia Orchestras - also as concerto soloist, and independently as a recitalist. 

His continuing work as Principal Bassoon with the Canberra Symphony Orchestra dates back to student days of 1965 - 67. If you'd like to hear some of his work as bassoonist, chamber musician, and arranger, you'll find it on YouTube under Canberra Wind Soloists.
Simultaneously, he has sustained a career as one of Australia's most respected bassoon teachers, at all levels from beginner to post-graduate and professional. In addition he has worked tirelessly in the development of orchestral and ensemble skills with students of all instruments, particularly at the advanced tertiary level. He was for many years a regular tutor and conductor at the Australian Youth Orchestra's National Music Camps. He has taught over many years in south-east Asia. 

His work as a conductor is well-known, particularly in Canberra. He was Conductor and Musical Director of the Canberra Youth Orchestra from 1980 - 1990, greatly broadening its repertoire and general endeavour, and led it on three highly-successful and widely-acclaimed European tours. His Canberra contribution has included development of and much work with the School of Music Orchestra, Canberra Opera, Canberra Philharmonic Society, thirteen-years as Musical Director of The Llewellyn Choir (with development of its accompanying professional ensemble, The Canberra Chamber Orchestra), and three years as Musical Director of The Oriana Chorale. 

His numerous conducting activities outside of Canberra have included the foundation and development of the Barrier Reef Orchestra, with which he continues his association as Artistic Advisor and frequent conductor. 

His 35-year career at the Canberra (now ANU) School of Music played a significant part in the creation of its erstwhile international reputation. Awards have included 1986 Canberran of the Year, Advance Australia, Sounds Australian, and National Critics' Circle awards. In 1992 he was granted an Order of Australia Medal, for services to Music and Music Education, particularly for his work with the Canberra Youth Orchestra. In 2013, he was elected President of the Australian Double Reed Society.</p>

Currently he serves as Artistic Director and Principal Conductor of Zelman Symphony Orchestra, the Ballarat Symphony and the Macquarie Philharmonia.

Most recently, Mark developed a Regional Orchestra Weekend for ensembles from across Victoria to meet and perform together, with the aim to make this an annual event. 
Mark is also passionate about the education and training of future conductors, and has been frequently involved as a guest teacher of the Masters of Conducting students at the Melbourne Conservatorium in 2015</p>

                 <p>Adam Lopez’s exceptional vocal artistry has paved opportunities to perform backing vocals for some of the biggest names in the music industry such as Mariah Carey, Keith Urban and The Coors. His most recent noted collaboration was headlining with Australian Jazz legend James Morrison in a string of Symphonic Concerts in Perth, Hobart and Brisbane. 

His discography includes an eclectic collection of genres spanning from Pop-Opera, Pop, Rhythm &Blues, Jazz, Power Ballads and Fiery Latin! 

His phenomenal vocal range smashed two Guinness World Records (one note above the range of a piano!) 

This achievement has astounded audiences from all around the world leading him to perform and appear on international television and radio stations in Japan, Spain, Italy, Korea, Hong Kong and the USA. 

Adam Lopez has undoubtedly got one of the most fascinating vocal instruments on the planet. He delighted audiences when he sang in Townsville with the Barrier Orchestra in 2012 along with Sean O’Boyle and James Morrison.</p>

                  <p>Domenico is one of Brisbane’s most experienced and versatile multicultural entertainers. He has performed in almost every possible style since he commenced his musical career in 1971 at age 4. He studied music on the traditional European instrument called the Piano Accordion and this is still his chosen instrument, although he also now uses the latest electronic midi accordion which incorporates other built in instruments. 

Domenico moved from three piece cabaret bands to a more sophisticated five piece band, the Latin Mafia which performs swing and Latin classics from the Rat Pack era. 

He has performed in many venues from QPAC with the Queensland Pops Orchestra to being runners up with his Celtic Band, Murphy’s Pigs at the Tamworth Golden Fiddle Awards.</p>

                  <p>Richard has maintained a long and distinguished career as bassoonist, music educator, conductor and arranger. A Composition graduate from Sydney University, he was appointed Associate Principal Bassoon with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra as a 20-year-old in 1968, moving to The Canberra School of Music as a foundation member of the Canberra Wind Soloists in 1978. With this renowned quintet, he recorded and toured internationally during a 30-year period, and gave it a unique repertoire with his virtuoso arrangements of large-scale orchestral works. He was for many years Principal Bassoon with the Australian Chamber Orchestra, and appeared on many occasions as guest Principal Bassoon with most of the Symphony Australia Orchestras - also as concerto soloist, and independently as a recitalist. 

His continuing work as Principal Bassoon with the Canberra Symphony Orchestra dates back to student days of 1965 - 67. If you'd like to hear some of his work as bassoonist, chamber musician, and arranger, you'll find it on YouTube under Canberra Wind Soloists.
Simultaneously, he has sustained a career as one of Australia's most respected bassoon teachers, at all levels from beginner to post-graduate and professional. In addition he has worked tirelessly in the development of orchestral and ensemble skills with students of all instruments, particularly at the advanced tertiary level. He was for many years a regular tutor and conductor at the Australian Youth Orchestra's National Music Camps. He has taught over many years in south-east Asia. 

His work as a conductor is well-known, particularly in Canberra. He was Conductor and Musical Director of the Canberra Youth Orchestra from 1980 - 1990, greatly broadening its repertoire and general endeavour, and led it on three highly-successful and widely-acclaimed European tours. His Canberra contribution has included development of and much work with the School of Music Orchestra, Canberra Opera, Canberra Philharmonic Society, thirteen-years as Musical Director of The Llewellyn Choir (with development of its accompanying professional ensemble, The Canberra Chamber Orchestra), and three years as Musical Director of The Oriana Chorale. 

His numerous conducting activities outside of Canberra have included the foundation and development of the Barrier Reef Orchestra, with which he continues his association as Artistic Advisor and frequent conductor. 

His 35-year career at the Canberra (now ANU) School of Music played a significant part in the creation of its erstwhile international reputation. Awards have included 1986 Canberran of the Year, Advance Australia, Sounds Australian, and National Critics' Circle awards. In 1992 he was granted an Order of Australia Medal, for services to Music and Music Education, particularly for his work with the Canberra Youth Orchestra. In 2013, he was elected President of the Australian Double Reed Society.</p>
